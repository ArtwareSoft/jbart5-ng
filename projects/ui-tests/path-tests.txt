dynamic to static
  pick & edit

static to dynamic
  highlight
  refresh
  probe


issues:
=============

using global component
---------------------
group using global group. pick&edit should return caller.
put caller path in componentContext

PT By Examples
----------------------------
itemlist using group

sugar
------------------------
static and dynamic should use actual json path
$pipline: [], $runActions: [], $filter :{$..}, $not :{ $}
{$asIs : { .. }}


path tester
===============
control to test that includes $probe
static path
probe
count_highlighted

pick&edit selector = [jb-path]='%$staticPath%'

tests- 
	static path - calc static path of $probe and compare it to static path
	pick&edit - look for the static path at the pick&edit selector
	highlight - count pick&edit selector and check against count_highlighted
	refresh - log all cmp.ctx.path against jb-path and caller-path
	probe - run the probe. use control as circuit. check that probe result is not empty.
