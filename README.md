#Visual Development with angular2

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/jbartcommunity/jbart5-material.png)

Visual development was broken in the world of web development, mostly because pre-defined visual components could not be re-used anymore.
The industry accepts the fact that complex web apps can be developed only textually.

However, jBart suggests a revolutionary approach for visual development of complex apps that actually works.

##Visual Development Concepts
- pick & edit (like in Chrome debugger)
- work by example data
- smart data/code guidance in context
- preserve the full power of angular2 & javascript

##Visual Development Benefits
- faster delivery
- enhance quality
- reduce development/maintenance costs
- less technical people can build complex business apps
- develop larger projects
- enhance team work effectiveness

##jBart is written by itself
- core is written in angular2
- studio is written by itself (like the C compiler written in C)

##Who Use jBart?
- large teams
- hybrid teams: architects build the components, implementers build the applications
